SOLID Design Principles

S - Single Responsibility Principle - Every class should do only one task
O - Open Closed Principle - Open for extension and closed for modification. 
    Think of a class and in that we should not change any function but inherited class can extend the behavior by adding new functions
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle - Similar to Single Responsibility Principle. Here every interface should different puropose
D - Dependency Inversion Principle
