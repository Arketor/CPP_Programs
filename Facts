1.  int main()
    We cannot define Main Function in a namespace. It has to be in Global Namespace i.e :: 
    So main function is actually ::main()
    Below example will throw compilation error
  
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    namespace fds
    {
        int a=1;
        int main()
        {
            cout<<a;
            return 0;
        }
    }
  
 
 
2.  a) abc fun(const abc &o) = We used reference to avoid creating extra object so we save memory as well as a call to a copy constructor.
    b) const is used so that no modifications are done to object and also for this reason : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-constructor-argument-const/?ref=rp
    
    
3.  Dont use try catch in Testing (Unit Testing), i.e dont catch exceptions in Unit Tests, because if we use it, tests will not fail where they should fail.

4.  Friends Functions can be use to access any(Private also) members of the class in which they are declared as friend. Return type and parameters can be objects
    of other class also.
    
5.  vptr is instance member variable which means for every object there will be different vptr. vtable is static member(its a static array) of a class.
