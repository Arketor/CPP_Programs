1.  int main()
    We cannot define Main Function in a namespace. It has to be in Global Namespace i.e :: 
    So main function is actually ::main()
    Below example will throw compilation error
  
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    namespace fds
    {
        int a=1;
        int main()
        {
            cout<<a;
            return 0;
        }
    }
  
 
 
2.  a) abc fun(const abc &o) = We used reference to avoid creating extra object so we save memory as well as a call to a copy constructor.
    b) const is used so that no modifications are done to object and also for this reason : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-constructor-argument-const/?ref=rp
