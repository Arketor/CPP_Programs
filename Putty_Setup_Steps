Step 1, Generate the Key
run PuTTYgen
move your mouse around to give it "randomness"
wait for it to generate the key
Step 2, Save the Private Key
click the "Save private key" button
Yes, save it with a strong passphrase
remember where you put this (My Documents\private.ppk is a good place).
you should probably make the file read-only, and readable only by you
Step 3, Add the Public Key to unix
DO NOT use the "Save public key" button!! It will save the file in the wrong format.
Copy the Key Text displayed in "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file"
log in to unix
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
cd ~/.ssh
vim authorized_keys
paste the text here and save the file (don't introduce any newlines - this key should go on a single line)
Step 4, set up PuTTY to use the key
in PuTTY Configuration
under: Connection -> SSH -> Auth
Click the "Browse..." button next to "Private key file for authentication"
browse to your Private Key file from Step 2
under: Connection -> Data
type your username in the "Auto-login username" box
under: Session
Save your Configuration Session, so you don't have to do this again
You should now be able to run PuTTY and connect to a linux machine without being prompted for a password. You can use a similar trick to be able to ssh between different linux boxes
